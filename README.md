* Reviews
    * Authenticated Users can submit a review for a movie, or edit/delete their review if they have previously submitted one.
## Challenges
We ran into some problems along the way including: 
* We learned quickly how important it is to ensure that nobody pushes to the main branch without a review process, and to commit early and often to keep all the branches updated.
* A script we implemented to hide the review edit form until a button is clicked was toggling correctly between hidden and visible, but was incorractly displaying as visible at first. We fixed this by reordering our css file. Order is important!
* Not really a bug, but implementing a star rating system for each movie was alot more challenging than expected and I have a new appreciation for that feature in other sites.
## Code Highlights
* Star reviews rendering in pug for each movie:
```
div.star-container
    -let score
        each review in reviews
            -const num = Object.values(movie.Reviews).map(review => review.rating).reduce((a,b) => {return a + b}, 0)
            -const total = movie.Reviews.length
            -score = num/(total * 1.0)
            -score = Math.round(score)
        div(id="starContainer")
            -let i = 0
            -let j = score
            while i < score
                span(class="fa fa-star checked")
                -i++
```
